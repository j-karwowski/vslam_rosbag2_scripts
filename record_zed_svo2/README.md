# record_zed_svo2

Just after the start of recording SVO2 file, one will probably encounter the following error in the ZED Wrapper:

```console
[zed_wrapper-2] [ERROR] [1720617715.764761326] [zed.zed_node]: Error saving frame to SVO
```

While the saved SVO2 file is playable afterwards, it **might** be fully repaired with [ZED_SVO_Editor -repair](https://community.stereolabs.com/t/remote-svo-recording-error/3962/2).
